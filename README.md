Adaptive Retrieval-Augmented Generation Learning (RAGL) System
Project Overview
The RAGL system implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach, designed for continuous learning with intelligent responses based on accumulated knowledge from various document formats. It provides a flexible framework for document processing, retrieval, and real-time learning.

Key Features
Multi-Format Document Processing
PDF, Word (DOC/DOCX), Excel (XLS/XLSX)

PowerPoint (PPT/PPTX), CSV, JSON, XML

HTML, Text (TXT, MD)

Intelligent Learning System
Continuous updates to the knowledge base

Adaptive retrieval and response generation

Vector-based information storage for efficient search

Feedback-driven learning for continuous improvement

Modern User Interface
Streamlit-based interactive chat interface

Easy document upload and management

Real-time response generation and feedback tracking

Session management and learning event tracking

Technical Architecture
Core Components
